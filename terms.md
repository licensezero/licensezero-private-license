# Summary

This is a private license for software, granted by a software developer through their agent to a specific user.

# Details

- The **Developer** is `developer name`, `developer jurisdiction` (ISO 3166-2), `developer e-mail`.

- The **Agent** is `agent name`, `agent jurisdiction` (ISO 3166-2), `agent website`.

- The **User** is `user name`, `user jurisdiction` (ISO 3166-2), `user e-mail`.

- The **Project** is `project repository`, `project description`.

- The **Price** is `price` (USD).

- The **Term** begins on `date` (ISO 8601) and continues `term`.

- The **Offer Identifier** is `offer identifier`.

# Payment

All the licenses granted under these terms are conditional on payment of the _Price_.  If there is no _Price_, the _Developer_ nonetheless expects the _User_ to rely on this license nonetheless, and will not revoke it unless the _User_ breaks one of its rules.

# Scope

The **Licensed Contributions** are the contributions the _Developer_ has made to the _Project_ with the _Offer Identifier_ in metadata, as well as any contributions the _Developer_ makes to the _Project_ in the future without changing the _Offer Identifier_ or adding a new one.  _Licensed Contributions_ do not include any contributions the _Developer_ makes to the project in the future with a different or additional identifier.

# Copyright

The _Developer_ licenses the _User_ for the _Term_ to do everything with the _Licensed Contributions_ that would otherwise infringe the _Developer_'s copyright in them.

# Patent

The _Developer_ licenses the _User_ for the _Term_ to do everything with the _Project_ that would otherwise infringe patent claims the _Developer_ can license or becomes able to license.

# Sublicensing

If the _User_ combines some or all of the _Licensed Contributions_ with other software in a larger application, the _User_ may pass on their license rights, or sublicense, those _Licensed Contributions_ as part of their larger application, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under the following rules:

## Value

The larger application must have significant additional content or functionality beyond that of the _Project_, and end users must license the larger application primarily for that added content or functionality.

## Maintenance

The _User_ may sublicense others to maintain the larger application, but not to use the _Licensed Contributions_ in new or different ways in that application, or to develop larger applications of their own.

## Purpose

The purpose of [Value](#value) and [Maintenance](#maintenance) is to prevent the _User_ from sublicensing others who should buy their own private licenses.

## Terms

[Sublicensing](#sublicensing) and [Notices](#notices), as well as warranty disclaimers and damages exclusions at least as broad as [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) and [Exclusion](#exclusion), must apply to each sublicense.

## Unlimited Applications

The _User_ may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as they like.

# Notices

In order to make sure that everyone who gets a copy of the _Licensed Contributions_ knows about the license terms for their use, the _Developer_ agrees to give everyone who gets a copy of some or all of the _Licensed Contributions_ from them, with or without changes, the text of this license and any public license for the _Licensed Contributions_.

# Agency

The _Developer_ has authorized the _Agent_ to sign this license on the _Developer_'s behalf.  The _Agent_ is not a party to this license.

# Guarantee

The _Developer_ guarantees that they either own or have the rights to license copyrights in the _Licensed Contributions_, and are aware that legal rules and agreements can make others the owners of copyrights in their work.

# Disclaimer

!!! With the sole exception of [Guarantee](#guarantee), as far as the law allows, the _Project_ comes as is, without any warranty or condition.

# Exclusion

!!! With the sole exception of [Guarantee](#guarantee), as far as the law allows, neither the _Developer_ nor their _Agent_ will be liable to anyone for any damages related to the _Project_ or this license, under any kind of legal claim.
