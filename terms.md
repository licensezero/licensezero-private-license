## Development

The _User_ may not sublicense anyone to break any rule of any public license for the _Licensed Contributions_ for any changes of their own or any software besides the larger application.

## Passthrough

[Sublicensing](#sublicensing) as [Notices](#notices), as well as warranty disclaimers and and damages exclusions at least as broad as [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) and [Exclusion](#exclusion), must apply to each sublicense.

## Unlimited Applications

The _User_ may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as they like.
